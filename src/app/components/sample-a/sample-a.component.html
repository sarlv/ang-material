    <p>DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson
        and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge
        in 1953, whose model-building
        efforts were guided by <strong>X-ray diffraction data</strong> acquired by
        Raymond Gosling, who was a post-graduate student of
        Rosalind Franklin.</p>

    <p>DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and
        theories, such as the
        ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity.</p>
    <p>The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive
        molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and
        nano-fabrication.</p>
    <p>Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid
        materials.</p>
